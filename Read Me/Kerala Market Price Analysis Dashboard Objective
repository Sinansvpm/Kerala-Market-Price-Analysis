Key Insights / Learnings

Black Pepper, Arecanut, and Coconut Oil dominate Kerala’s market volume.

Modal price trends show significant fluctuations across years (high seasonality).

Arecanut and Pepper show extremely high price volatility (unstable pricing).

Cashewnuts, Pepper garbled have more stability compared to spices.

Dataset reveals strong market dependency on certain commodities.

Power BI’s DAX calculations help uncover price gaps and ranking insights.
